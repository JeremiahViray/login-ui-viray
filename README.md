Hello! This is a login ui that I created in html and styled in css. This was created for me to practice my front end skills. It is static at this point as there is no scripting that has been added.

*Update (11/11/2023 @ 21:12)*
I added a media query so the layout changes on wider screens.

Below are screenshots of the first drafts. I would like to plan on making the UI more responsive and add media queries
